We recently updated our support for copy/pasting data into Excalidraw and converting it to a _beautiful_ chart. All you have to do is to copy a two column table, paste it in your scene and the rest is up to us.

<!-- end -->

## Examples

You copy any two columns data from Excal, Spreadsheet or even HTML tables and paste it directly to Excalidraw. This is the generated chart from the data below it.

| Oct   |      484 |

| Dec   |      687 |

But it doesn't stop here. You can copy the data from a text file as comma separated values (CSV). Open your favorite editor type the values, copy/paste and you are ready to go.

## Modifying the chart

Once the chart is inserted you can very easily select it and change some of the properties to adjust it to your needs. With just a few clicks we could have the following result.
