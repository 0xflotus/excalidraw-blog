One of the hidden features of Excalidraw, is that you can generate _beautiful_ charts in seconds. We recently updated our support for copying any two column data from another source and by pasting it in your scene, we generate a bar chart automagically. Read on to find out how.

## Examples

Copy any two columns data from Excel, Spreadsheet, or even HTML tables and paste it directly to Excalidraw (note: you need to have at least one column that contains numbers). This is the generated chart from the data below it.

| Oct   |      484 |
| Nov   |      288 |
| Dec   |      687 |

But it doesn't stop there. You can also copy the data from a plain text file as comma separated values (CSV). Open your favorite editor type the values separated by comma or tab, copy/paste and you are ready to go. Here is another example from the data bellow the chart.

## Modifying the chart

Once the chart is imported you can select it and change any of the properties to adjust it to your needs. With just a few clicks we could have the following result.

## Implementation

The implementation of this feature was done in two iterations and if you are interested on how it was done, check out the first [pull request](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1723) by [petehunt](https://github.com/petehunt) and the [second one](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2495) by [lipis](https://github.com/lipis). It quite an _experimental_ feature and overall works fine, but if you find any edge case that you think it should convert it to a char but it's not, [submit an issue](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues).
